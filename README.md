# Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL (and C++)

I am following this book with Ada 2022.

## Maths

I already had a library I used back when I started to port the NeHe tutorials,
these are out of date, and are Ada95. These were also written when SSE were
only just coming into use and some people may not have had them yet, the matrix
multiplication algorithm is an an optimised one from one of the Graphics Gems
books.

I started to rewrite this library in March 2024 with the intention of utilising
at least AVX on Intel and NEON on ARM. The library is currently written unoptimised
so that the compiler can do so. I will be using that libary here and completing it.
