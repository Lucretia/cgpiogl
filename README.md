# Computer Graphics Programming in OpenGL (and C++)

I am following this book with Ada 2022.

## Maths

I already had a library I used back when I started to port the NeHe tutorials,
these are out of date, and are Ada95. These were also written when SSE were
only just coming into use and some people may not have had them yet, the matrix
multiplication algorithm is an an optimised one from one of the Graphics Gems
books.

I started to rewrite this library with the intention of utilising at least
AVX, so I will be using that here.
